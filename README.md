The Shrike
==========

The Shrike is a Layer 7 Chaos HTTP/WebSocket proxy that impales it's victims on the Tree of Pain. The Tree of Pain for this Shrike takes the form of [Toxiproxy](http://toxiproxy.io), an excellent TCP network tampering tool.

The Shrike has an API to route http path based traffic through a [Toxiproxy](http://toxiproxy.io) server for resliliency testing and on to a downstream server.

Develop
-------

This project uses [Go 1.8](https://golang.org/dl/) or later and uses [Glide](https://glide.sh/) for package management.

### Linux
```
make
```

### Mac
```
make mac
```

To add or update dependencies in the vendor folder, please use [Glide](https://glide.sh/):

```
curl https://glide.sh/get | sh # only necessary if you don't have Glide installed already.
glide install
```

Testing
-------

Run the test suites with [Ginkgo](http://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/) installed and get coverage output:

```
make ginkgo
```

Run the test suites without Ginkgo (less awesome output, no randomization of tests):

```
make test
```
